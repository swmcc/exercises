## Introduction 

  - [rules](https://github.com/swmcc/exercises/issues/2)

This is a WIP. I want to finish this by Friday 1st of May.

## Development

   ```gem install rspec```

   ```rspec spec/cards_rspec.rb```

## Postmortem

I am thinking of starting again. I didn't design this out properly and am now 
suffering the consequences of such actions.

Commits [448845](https://github.com/swmcc/exercises/commit/448845e93a3781827754505bf6f107cd4e6e12a6) - [4997df5](https://github.com/swmcc/exercises/commit/4997df5615750471d7bc65898f1c63d57a0ec489) should be now be considered null and void.

I don't feel too bad about this though - the whole point was to exercise my 
development brain and EVERYTHING is a learning experience.
