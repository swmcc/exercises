## Description

I reuse to use the 'Kata'... However they can explain it better than I can so here goes:

```
A code kata is an exercise in programming which helps a programmer hone their skills through practice and repetition. The term was probably first coined by Dave Thomas, co-author of the book The Pragmatic Programmer, in a bow to the Japanese concept of kata in the martial arts.
```

This is a  simple index repo for the programming exercises that I want to do.
There will be no code in here, The only thing that will change in here
will be the README with links to the programming excerises I do. 

The main objective of this repo is to keep me honest in doing them. I will aim
for one a week in various languages and link them in this repo.

I know there are various sites out there that will help me do this. However
I find most of them boring and I want to do this for a bit of fun as well.
Also with each exercise being a 'repo' I will be able to go back and view the
commit history. It will also keep me honest :)
